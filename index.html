                <h3 class="Info_1">Fredbear's Family Diner was a pizzarea in the 1980's, founded by best mate William Afton and Henry Emily.
                    <br>
                    William had two sons and one daughter; Michael, the eldest, Elizabeth, the middle, and The Crying Child/Evan, the youngest. Unfortunately, Evan would die
                    after a tradgic incident involving his bully brother and his friends, when they stuffed his head inside of Fredbear's mouth, knowing that Evan's
                    most extreme fear was Fredbear. Fredbear then coincidentally slammed his mouth shut with Evan still in it, and Evan died around a week later. What makes
                    this story even more upsetting is that the incident happened on Evan's own birthday. Obviously, William and Henry had to close down because of this
                    and sold the Fredbear name, before creating a new pizzarea, Freddy Fazbear's.
